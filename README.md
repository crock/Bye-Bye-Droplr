# Bye-Bye, Droplr.

## Wait, wut?

The Droplr file sharing system decided to discontinue all free accounts without giving them a way to retrieve their data easily.

**This script will therefore allow you to download all the files you stored on Droplr.**

## Usage

Install Node.JS.

Run the script:

	node bye-bye-droplr.js

Enter your credentials, and let the magic happen.
